# 自我介绍(中文)

面试官好，我叫马标，是苏州大学软件工程专业的一名应届研究生。我准备从学习，实践和生活三个方面介绍一下自己。

学习方面，我的研究方向为工业互联网安全，这是一个和西门子合作的研究项目。在校期间，我认真学习两次获得苏州大学学业奖学金，在今年七月份获得了苏州大学优秀研究生荣誉。研一阶段参加江苏省研究生网络空间安全大赛，获得了省级三等奖。

社会实践方面，研一阶段参加校研会“小爱无声”社团，这是一个爱心社团。在社团里我组织和参加了“中秋节敬老院献爱心活动”，“元旦贺卡义卖活动”和“地铁站志愿者活动”，真实体会到付出也是回报的道理。项目实践方面，我完成了两个横向项目，分别是脉氧项目和地磁项目。脉氧项目是和医院合作，完成对重症病人脉氧脉率的检测发现异常及时报告给医务人员，地磁项目是我实习时候的项目，主要是实现路边无感地停车收费服务。通过这些项目实践真实得将自己学到的东西转为实际产品，提高了自己的动手能力。

生活方面，我喜欢美食也喜欢烹饪。我擅长与人沟通，也结交了一群交心的朋友。我的座右铭是时刻保持做一个努力的人，做一个有趣的人。



# 自我介绍(英文)

Hello interviewer. My name is Ma Biao. I am a fresh graduate student majoring in Software Engineering at Soochow University. I am going to introduce myself from the three aspects of study, practice and life.

In terms of learning, my research direction is industrial Internet security, which is a longitudinal project in cooperation with Siemens. During the school, I studied earnestly and won the academic scholarship of Soochow University twice, and won the honor of outstanding graduate student of Soochow University in July this year. In the first year of postgraduate, I participated in the Jiangsu Postgraduate Cyberspace Security Competition and won the provincial third prize.

In terms of social practice, in the first stage of research, I participated in the Student Union "Little Love Silent" club, which is a caring club. In the club, I organized and participated in the "Mid-Autumn Festival Nursing Home Dedication Activity", the "New Year's Day Greeting Card Sale" and the "Subway Station Volunteer Activity", and I truly realized that giving is also a reward. In terms of project practice, I have completed two resume projects, namely the pulse oxygen project and the geomagnetic project. The pulse oxygen project is to cooperate with the hospital to complete the detection of the pulse oxygen and pulse rate of critically ill patients and report it to the medical staff in time. The geomagnetic project is a project during my internship, mainly to realize the roadside parking fee service without feeling. Through the practice of these projects, I can turn what I have learned into actual products and improve my hands-on ability.

In terms of life, I like food and cooking. I am good at communicating with people and I have also made a group of close friends. My motto is to always be a hard worker and an interesting person.
